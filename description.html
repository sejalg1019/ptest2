                <h2>A quick description about this website</h2>
                <p>First of all, I am so sorry for giving you your present so late. 
                  I wanted to make you a present. The problem is that I have no artistic ability, whatsoever. 
                  I began thinking about what I'm kind of good at. Coding! Keyword: kind of. I tried my best to make 
                  a website for your birthday. It's definitely not the best, but it's the best I can do for now. 
                  The fact that I'm coding you a website for your present is kind of nerdy, but women in STEM. 
                  Despite all of this, I really hope you like it! 
                  <br>       
                  <br>Quick fun fact: I coded ___ lines of code to make you
                  this website.
